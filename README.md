Malaysia Rental Rate Predictor (Streamlit App)
This project is an extension project from my previous KL/Selangor rental price prediction project. This is a web application built with Streamlit to predict the rental category (Low, Medium, or High) of residential properties in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Malaysia.

The prediction is based on property features, amenities, and location data.

Model & Prediction Logic
The core prediction is handled by an XGBoost Classifier trained on local property data.

Prediction Categories:

Low: From RM1,575 and below

Medium: Between RM1,576 to RM3,545

High: From RM3,546 and above
